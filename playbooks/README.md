# Ansible Playbooks Directory

## 📌 What is the `playbooks/` Directory?
The `playbooks/` directory in an Ansible project is used to **store individual playbooks** that define automation tasks for managing systems and applications.

## 📦 Why Use the `playbooks/` Directory?
- 🛠 **Keeps playbooks organized** in a central location.
- 🔄 **Separates logic from roles**, allowing reuse across multiple environments.
- 🚀 **Facilitates structured automation** by maintaining clear, modular workflows.

## 📄 How to Structure the `playbooks/` Directory
A typical `playbooks/` directory contains structured playbooks:
```
playbooks/
├── site.yml               # Main playbook including all others
├── docker-deploy.yml      # Deploys Docker containers
├── proxmox-config.yml     # Configures Proxmox settings
├── security-hardening.yml # Security configurations
├── monitoring.yml         # Installs and configures monitoring tools
```

## 🔍 Creating a Playbook
Playbooks are YAML files that define automation steps for managed hosts.

### 🔹 Example: `playbooks/site.yml`
```yaml
- name: Configure all servers
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - common
    - security
    - monitoring
```

### 🔹 Running a Playbook
To execute a playbook, use:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml
```

### 🔹 Using Tags for Selective Execution
Tags allow you to run specific parts of a playbook:
```yaml
- name: Install and configure Nginx
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags:
        - install

    - name: Start Nginx
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      tags:
        - start
```
Run only the `install` tasks:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml --tags install
```

## 🏆 Best Practices
- **Use `site.yml` as the main entry point**, including all other playbooks.
- **Keep playbooks modular**, separating concerns (e.g., security, monitoring, deployments).
- **Leverage roles** to encapsulate reusable configurations.
- **Use tags** for flexibility in execution.
- **Maintain consistency in naming** (e.g., `playbooks/docker-deploy.yml`).

The `playbooks/` directory provides a structured approach to automation, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and scalability in Ansible workflows.
