# Ansible Handlers Directory
handlers/README.md

## What is the `handlers/` Directory?

The `handlers/` directory in an Ansible role is used to store **handlers**, which are special tasks that are triggered only when notified by other tasks.

## Why Use the `handlers/` Directory?

* **Ensures tasks are only executed when necessary**, reducing unnecessary operations.
* **Enhances efficiency** by preventing redundant service restarts or reloads.
* **Keeps playbooks modular** by separating event-driven tasks from regular tasks.

## How to Use the `handlers/` Directory

### Defining a Handler

Handlers are written in YAML inside `handlers/main.yml`.
Example: `handlers/main.yml`

```yaml
- name: Restart Nginx
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
```

### Calling a Handler from a Task

To use a handler, another task **must notify it**:

```yaml
- name: Update Nginx configuration
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: files/nginx.conf
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: Restart Nginx
```

**The handler runs only if this task changes the file.**

### Using Multiple Handlers

You can notify multiple handlers from a single task:

```yaml
- name: Deploy configuration
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: templates/app.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/app.conf
  notify:
    - Restart App Service
    - Reload Systemd
```

## When Do Handlers Execute?

Handlers execute **at the end of a play** unless explicitly forced:

```yaml
- name: Restart Nginx Immediately
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  listen: Restart Now
  notify: Restart Nginx

- meta: flush_handlers  # Forces handlers to run immediately
```

## Best Practices

* **Use handlers for service restarts and reloads** to avoid unnecessary disruptions.
* **Keep handler names descriptive** (e.g., `Reload Firewall` instead of `handler_1`).
* **Group similar handlers in `handlers/main.yml`** for better organization.
* **Avoid running `flush_handlers` unless necessary**, as it disrupts normal execution flow.

The `handlers/` directory is essential for efficient and event-driven Ansible automation, ensuring that changes take effect only when needed.
