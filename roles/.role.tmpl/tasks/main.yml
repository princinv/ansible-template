# ==========================================
# ROLE TASKS
# ==========================================
# Purpose:
#   Serves as the primary entry point for all tasks in this role.
#   Typically includes or imports other task files to maintain
#   a modular, organized structure.
#
# Guidelines:
#   - Keep this file minimalâ€”use `include_tasks` or `import_tasks`
#     to bring in logically grouped task files (e.g., install.yml,
#     configure.yml, service.yml).
#   - Ensure task names are descriptive for clear Ansible output.
#   - Maintain idempotence in all tasks to avoid unnecessary changes.
#   - Use conditional includes for environment- or platform-specific logic.
#
# Notes:
#   Variables for this role are defined in:
#     - defaults/main.yml (low priority, overridable)
#     - vars/main.yml (higher priority, static role values)
