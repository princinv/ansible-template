# Ansible Vars Directory

## 📌 What is the `vars/` Directory?
The `vars/` directory in an Ansible project or role is used to **store variable definitions** that help manage dynamic values across playbooks.

## 📦 Why Use the `vars/` Directory?
- 🛠 **Centralizes variable management** for consistency across roles and playbooks.
- 🔄 **Allows easy customization** without modifying playbooks directly.
- 🚀 **Enhances reusability** by defining values that can be overridden when needed.

## 📄 How to Structure the `vars/` Directory
A typical `vars/` directory contains YAML files defining role-specific variables:
```
vars/
├── main.yml          # Primary variable file
├── app_config.yml    # Variables for application deployment
├── security.yml      # Security-related variables
```

## 🔍 Defining Variables in `vars/`
### 🔹 Example: `vars/main.yml`
```yaml
dependency_packages:
  - curl
  - unzip
  - git

app_port: 8080
app_name: my_application
```

## 🚀 Using Variables in Playbooks
Once defined, variables from `vars/` can be used in tasks:
```yaml
- name: Install required packages
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name: "{{ dependency_packages }}"
    state: present

- name: Configure application
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: templates/app_config.j2
    dest: /etc/app/config.yml
```

## 🔹 Overriding Variables
Variables in `vars/` can be overridden by:
1. **`defaults/` variables (lowest priority)**
2. **`vars/` variables (higher priority than defaults)**
3. **Command-line extra vars (highest priority)**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "app_port=9090"
   ```

## 🏆 Best Practices
- **Store variables in `defaults/` when possible**, reserving `vars/` for role-specific overrides.
- **Use descriptive variable names** to improve readability (`app_db_password` instead of `password`).
- **Avoid hardcoded secrets**—use Ansible Vault for sensitive values.
- **Document important variables** within `vars/main.yml`.

The `vars/` directory plays a key role in making Ansible playbooks dynamic, flexible, and reusable.
